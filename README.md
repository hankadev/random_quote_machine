## Objective

Built an app that is functionally similar to [this](https://codepen.io/freeCodeCamp/full/qRZeGZ).
Fulfill the below user stories and get all of the tests to pass. Give it your own personal style.

User stories:

- **User Story #1:** I can see a wrapper element with a corresponding `id="quote-box"`.
- **User Story #2:** Within `#quote-box`, I can see an element with a corresponding `id="text"`.
- **User Story #3:** Within `#quote-box`, I can see an element with a corresponding `id="author"`.
- **User Story #4:** Within `#quote-box`, I can see a clickable element with a corresponding `id="new-quote"`.
- **User Story #5:** Within `#quote-box`, I can see a clickable `a` element with a corresponding `id="tweet-quote"`.
- **User Story #6:** On first load, my quote machine displays a random quote in the element with `id="text"`.
- **User Story #7:** On first load, my quote machine displays the random quote's author in the element with `id="author"`.
- **User Story #8:** When the `#new-quote` button is clicked, my quote machine should fetch a new quote and display it in the `#text` element.
- **User Story #9:** My quote machine should fetch the new quote's author when the `#new-quote` button is clicked and display it in the `#author` element.
- **User Story #10:** I can tweet the current quote by clicking on the `#tweet-quote a` element. This `a` element should include the `"twitter.com/intent/tweet"` path in its `href` attribute to tweet the current quote.
- **User Story #11:** `#quote-box` wrapper element should be horizontally centered. Please run tests with browser's zoom level at 100% and page maximized.
